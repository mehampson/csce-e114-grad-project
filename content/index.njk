1. Clone the Eleventy starter of your choice. I used https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog. Trim out anything you don't plan to use.
2. Add a new site on Netlify, and link your repo to it. Then run `netlify init`
3. We're going to use Rust for our serverless function. See https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/14/write-netlify-functions-in-rust/
4. Make sure Rust is installed: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
5. Rust functions on Netlify are still experimental, so run: `netlify env:set NETLIFY_EXPERIMENTAL_BUILD_RUST_SOURCE true`
6. Run: `netlify functions:create --language=rust`. 
7. Set it up as a Serverless function
8. Default path is fine
9. Now you have some new files in `netlify/functions`. Be sure to run `git add` at this point to track your function's files.
